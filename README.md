Wingsuit Formation Judging Tool.
=====

I started this little project based on ideas from Jarno Cordia and Wingsuit Zach back in 2009 orso, and since updated it a couple times per year with new ideas and fixes. But I simply don't have the time and energy left to keep working on this. 

So to all wingsuiting engineers out there, fork it, improve it, whatever...
